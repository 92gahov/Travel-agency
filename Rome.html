            <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy. It is also
                the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named
                Comune di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), Rome is the country's
                most populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city
                limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous
                metropolitan city in Italy. Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. Rome is
                located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores
                of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[4] is an independent country inside the
                city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason, Rome has
                sometimes been described as the capital of two states. Rome is often referred to as the City of
                Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the "Eternal City."</p>

            <p>Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the
                site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia
                and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. The city's early population originated
                from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of
                the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever
                Imperial city and metropolis. It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna; Italian: La
                Città Eterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by
                Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. Rome is also called "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World). After the fall
                of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the
                political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States,
                which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455)
                pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city
                the artistic and cultural centre of the world. </p>

                <p>In 2019, Rome was the 11th most visited city in the world, with 10.1 million tourists, the third most
                    visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy. Its historic
                    centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics,
                    Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and
                    Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for
                    Agricultural Development (IFAD). The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly
                    of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many international
                    businesses, such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo S.p.A., and national and international banks such as
                    Unicredit and BNL. Rome's EUR business district is the home of many oil industry, the pharmaceutical
                    industry, and financial services companies. The presence of renowned international brands in the
                    city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios have been
                    the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="rome-places-t">
            <p>Rome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable
                immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique
                traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent "villas" (parks).
                Among the most significant resources are the many museums – Musei Capitolini, the Vatican Museums and
                the Galleria Borghese and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art – aqueducts, fountains,
                churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the Roman Forum, and the Catacombs.
                Rome is the third most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7–10
                million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years. The Colosseum (4 million tourists) and
                the Vatican Museums (4.2 million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in
                the world, according to a recent study.

                Rome is a major archaeological hub, and one of the world's main centres of archaeological research.
                There are numerous cultural and research institutes located in the city, such as the American Academy in
                Rome, and The Swedish Institute at Rome. Rome contains numerous ancient sites, including the
                Forum Romanum, Trajan's Market, Trajan's Forum, the Colosseum, and the Pantheon, to name but a few.
                The Colosseum, arguably one of Rome's most iconic archaeological sites, is regarded as a wonder of the
                world.Rome contains a vast and impressive collection of art, sculpture, fountains, mosaics, frescos, and
                paintings, from all different periods. Rome first became a major artistic centre during ancient Rome,
                with forms of important Roman art such as architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. Metal-work,
                coin die and gem engraving, ivory carvings, figurine glass, pottery, and book illustrations are
                considered to be 'minor' forms of Roman artwork.</p>

            <p>Rome is also widely recognised as a world fashion capital. Although not as important as Milan, Rome is
                the fourth most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 Global Language Monitor
                after Milan, New York, and Paris, and beating London.

                Major luxury fashion houses and jewellery chains, such as Valentino, Bulgari, Fendi, Laura
                Biagiotti, Brioni, and Renato Balestra, are headquartered or were founded in the city. Also, other major
                labels, such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, and Versace have luxury boutiques in
                Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale Via dei Condotti. Rome has a growing stock of
                contemporary and modern art and architecture. The National Gallery of Modern Art has works by Balla,
                Morandi, Pirandello, Carrà, De Chirico, De Pisis, Guttuso, Fontana, Burri, Mastroianni, Turcato,
                Kandisky, and Cézanne on permanent exhibition. 2010 saw the opening of Rome's newest arts foundation, a
                contemporary art and architecture gallery designed by acclaimed Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. Known as
                MAXXI – National Museum of the 21st Century Arts it restores a dilapidated area with striking modern
                architecture.</p>
